# Python Projects Using Data 

This repository contains 7 intermediate-level Python projects that apply programming concepts to practical, real-world scenarios.  
Each project emphasizes **problem solving, modular coding, and data handling**, while also introducing skills like API usage, web scraping, and file-based storage.  

### üîπ Summary of Skills Gained:
- **Data Structures & Logic:** Efficient use of dictionaries, lists, and JSON for storing and managing information  
- **File Handling & Persistence:** Reading and writing data in text, CSV, and JSON formats  
- **Data Processing:** Generating structured reports and summaries from datasets  
- **APIs & Networking:** Making HTTP requests, handling responses, and parsing JSON from external services  
- **Web Scraping:** Extracting and cleaning web content using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`  
- **Date & Time Management:** Implementing timers, countdowns, and event tracking with the `datetime` library  
- **Error Handling & Robustness:** Using `try-except` for safe input and reliable program execution  

These projects collectively demonstrate the transition from fundamental Python programming to building **functional applications** that can be extended into larger systems.
